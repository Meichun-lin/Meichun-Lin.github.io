# Write your biography below. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
# I am particularly interested in the exploration-exploitation trade-offs in online learning and decision making. My current work includes (i) developing near-optimal algorithms that balance the trade-offs and (ii) analyzing optimal decisions using tools such as dynamic programming.

Welcome to my site! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia. My advisors are Prof. [Tim Huh](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/tim-huh) and Prof. [Michael Jong Kim](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/michael-jong-kim). 

My research focuses on data-driven decision making with applications in inventory management, dynamic pricing, and uncertain search. I am particularly interested in (i) developing near-optimal algorithms that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-offs and (ii) analyzing optimal online decisions using tools such as dynamic programming.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My CV can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4k5bigvovesan7n/CV.pdf?dl=0). Here is a link to my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2027-0166).
